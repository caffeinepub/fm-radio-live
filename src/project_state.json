  "summary": "Global FM / “Gracy FM Radio Live” is a web/PWA app that loads thousands of worldwide radio stations from the Radio Browser API, provides search/selection UI, and streams the selected station with a resilient HTML5 audio player. The frontend is built with React + TanStack React Query (multi-layer caching and background lazy-loading optimized for slow networks), optional authentication via Internet Computer Internet Identity, and a Motoko backend canister that implements role-based access control plus user profile/statistics endpoints used by an authenticated user dashboard. The UI includes PWA install prompting, service-worker offline caching for core assets, donation modal, bookmarking, and a fully implemented 3D space + Earth/globe scene with radio pins and supporting UI elements (header/tagline/counter/toggles), with shadcn/ui components incorporated for consistent UI primitives.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend uses TanStack React Query as the primary async/state layer for station data and backend actor calls (query keys, staleTime/gcTime, invalidate/remove on refresh).",
    "Station list retrieval is optimized for slow networks via multi-layer client caching (in-memory + IndexedDB + localStorage) with TTL and periodic persistence, plus continuous background batch loading.",
    "Radio station fetching uses Radio Browser API with server failover and GPRS-friendly batching (limit/offset) and timeouts.",
    "Station processing pipeline performs coordinate validation, deterministic coordinate-based deduplication, scoring, and sorting before caching/serving data.",
    "Frontend authentication uses Internet Identity (AuthClient) with a React context provider; identity changes trigger actor recreation and query invalidation.",
    "Backend is a Motoko canister with role-based access control (admin/user/guest), using in-memory Maps keyed by Principal for state.",
    "PWA support via custom service worker (cache-first for static assets, network-first for navigations, network-only for streams/external APIs) plus registration/update hooks and an install prompt component.",
    "UI is modal-driven (search/dashboard/donation) and uses localStorage for lightweight user preferences (bookmarks, dismissals).",
    "3D rendering uses React Three Fiber + Three.js for a space/starfield backdrop (memoized geometries, per-frame animation).",
    "3D scene now includes a functional Earth/globe and coordinate-based radio pin rendering (EarthScene/Earth/RadioPins/RadioPin) integrated with the existing Three.js space backdrop."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "useQueries.ts uses module-level mutable state for lazy-loading/caches; multiple hook instances or hot reloads can cause cross-instance interference.",
    "AbortSignal.timeout() is used for fetch timeouts; older browsers may not support it without a polyfill.",
    "BlinkingStars updates star sizes using Math.random() every frame, which can cause unnecessary churn/GC and non-deterministic twinkle behavior.",
    "Audio spectrum analyzer visualization is not reacting to the currently playing audio stream (no response)."
