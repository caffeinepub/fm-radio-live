  "summary": "Diff adds a new RadioTowerOverlay with animated signal waves and updates App.tsx to import/use it alongside AudioSpectrumAnalyzer, but the provided truncation does not clearly show the new centered stacking container or confirm the FM logo overlay removal/cleanup and analyzer centering changes. An unrelated screen-orientation-lock behavior appears to have been introduced in App.tsx.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Move the AudioSpectrumAnalyzer overlay so it is visually centered in the middle of the screen (remove any extra offset that pushes it downward), while keeping it centered horizontally and vertically above the 3D scene; keep it non-interactive (pointer-events) and avoid layout regressions.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not include the specific layout/container CSS/classes (or any removed offsets) that would demonstrate the analyzer was re-centered vertically (especially on mobile) and kept pointer-events non-interactive. App.tsx is truncated before any overlay layout markup is shown.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Remove the centered FM logo overlay (stop rendering FmRadioCenterOverlay; ensure FM logo image no longer shown; remove unused imports/components).",
      "reason": "While App.tsx no longer shows an import of FmRadioCenterOverlay in the visible portion, the diff does not show the relevant render section (truncated) nor the actual changes inside FmRadioCenterOverlay.tsx (only that it was modified). Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that the FM logo is no longer rendered and that related code paths/imports were fully removed/cleaned.",

        "frontend/src/components/FmRadioCenterOverlay.tsx (modified, content not shown)"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Update center-overlay composition in frontend/src/App.tsx so radio-tower symbol and AudioSpectrumAnalyzer are arranged as a single centered vertical stack, and remove obsolete center-overlay code paths.",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated before the JSX for the center overlay is shown, so the presence of a single centered container, a vertical stack (tower above analyzer), and removal of obsolete overlay code paths cannot be directly verified from the provided diff excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"

  "hallucinated_features": [

      "description": "Screen orientation lock to portrait plus orientationchange prevention logic added to AppContent.",
      "reason": "Not requested by any requirement (REQ-16..REQ-19 are about centering overlays and replacing the logo), and it changes runtime behavior beyond repositioning overlays.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (shows useEffect that calls screen.orientation.lock('portrait') and adds an orientationchange listener)"
